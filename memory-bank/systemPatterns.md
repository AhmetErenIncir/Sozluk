# System Patterns
## Architecture Overview
- **Components**:
  - **Frontend**: Next.js application (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI) responsible for the user interface and interaction.
  - **Backend**: (To be defined, likely Node.js/Python with a database) responsible for data storage, API endpoints, and business logic.
  - **Database**: (To be defined) for storing dictionary entries, user data, and other application-specific information.
- **Data Flow**:
  - User interacts with the Frontend.
  - Frontend makes API requests to the Backend for word lookups, user authentication, etc.
  - Backend processes requests, interacts with the Database, and returns data to the Frontend.

## Design Patterns & Rationale
- **Component-Based Architecture (Frontend)**: Utilizes React components for modularity, reusability, and maintainability. Shadcn UI provides pre-built, customizable components.
- **API-Driven Development**: Clear separation between frontend and backend via RESTful or GraphQL APIs, allowing independent development and scaling.
- **Layered Architecture (Backend)**: (Anticipated) Separation of concerns into presentation, business logic, and data access layers for better organization and testability.

## Critical Paths
- **Search Performance**: The speed and efficiency of word lookup are critical for user experience. This involves optimized database queries and efficient data transfer.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring that dictionary definitions and related data are accurate and consistent across the system.
- **Scalability**: The ability to handle a growing number of users and dictionary entries without significant performance degradation.
