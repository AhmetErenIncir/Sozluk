# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview

- **Components**:
  - **Frontend**: Next.js application (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI) responsible for the user interface and interaction.
  - **Visual Thesaurus Graph**: Interactive force-directed graph system with WebGL rendering, collision detection, and Turkish text support.
  - **State Management**: Zustand stores for graph data persistence and React Context for authentication.
  - **Backend**: (To be defined, likely Node.js/Python with a database) responsible for data storage, API endpoints, and business logic.
  - **Database**: (To be defined) for storing dictionary entries, user data, and other application-specific information.
- **Data Flow**:
  - User interacts with Frontend (traditional search or graph navigation).
  - Frontend makes API requests to Backend for word lookups, user authentication, etc.
  - Graph system uses dedicated API endpoints for relationship data.
  - Backend processes requests, interacts with Database, and returns data to Frontend.
  - Graph Store manages visualization state with persistence layer.

## Design Patterns & Rationale

- **Component-Based Architecture (Frontend)**: Utilizes React components for modularity, reusability, and maintainability. Shadcn UI provides pre-built, customizable components.
- **Graph Visualization Pattern**: Force-directed layout with WebGL rendering for performance, collision detection for readability, and state persistence for user experience continuity.
- **State Management Layers**: Zustand for complex graph state, React Context for authentication, and URL state for shareable navigation.
- **API-Driven Development**: Clear separation between frontend and backend via RESTful or GraphQL APIs, allowing independent development and scaling.
- **Layered Architecture (Backend)**: (Anticipated) Separation of concerns into presentation, business logic, and data access layers for better organization and testability.

## Critical Paths

- **Search Performance**: The speed and efficiency of word lookup are critical for user experience. This involves optimized database queries and efficient data transfer.
- **Graph Rendering Performance**: WebGL-based visualization must maintain 60 FPS with collision detection and physics simulation for up to 50 nodes.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring that dictionary definitions and related data are accurate and consistent across the system.
- **Scalability**: The ability to handle a growing number of users and dictionary entries without significant performance degradation.
