- **Frontend Setup**:
  1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory: `cd frontend`
  2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
  3. Run the development server: `npm run dev` (usually runs on `http://localhost:3000` or `3001` if 3000 is occupied)
- **Backend Setup**: (To be documented once backend technology is chosen)

## Constraints
- **Performance**: The application must be highly responsive, especially for search queries.
- **Maintainability**: Codebase should be clean, well-documented, and easy to extend.
- **Security**: All data handling and user authentication must adhere to security best practices.
- **Scalability**: The architecture should support future growth in terms of users and data volume.
