# Project Brief

## Purpose & Vision

- This project aims to create a comprehensive dictionary application, named "Sozluk", with a clear separation between its frontend and backend components. The vision is to provide users with a fast, reliable, and feature-rich platform for exploring word meanings, translations, and linguistic insights across multiple languages.

## Scope & Boundaries

- Included:
  - Frontend: A modern web interface built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI, featuring a landing page, search functionality, and display of word definitions.
  - Visual Thesaurus: Interactive graph visualization for exploring word relationships with WebGL rendering and Turkish language support.
  - Backend: A robust API to serve dictionary data, handle user authentication, and manage data persistence.
  - Core dictionary functionalities: word search, definition display, and basic linguistic information.
- Excluded:
  - Advanced NLP features (e.g., sentiment analysis, complex linguistic parsing) in the initial phase.
  - Real-time collaborative features.
  - Mobile native applications (focus on web first).

## Success Criteria
