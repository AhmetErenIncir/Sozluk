## Decisions

- **Decision**: Implement a `memory-bank/` directory for project context management.
  - **Rationale**: Centralizes project knowledge, ensures consistency, and provides a clear reference for all team members and future development.
  - **Impact**: Improves project understanding, reduces onboarding time, and facilitates more efficient development cycles.
  - **Risks**: Requires diligent maintenance to keep information up-to-date.

## Open Questions & Assumptions

- **Open Questions**:
  - What specific database technology will be used for the backend?
  - What backend framework will be chosen (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go)?
  - Detailed API specifications for frontend-backend communication.
- **Assumptions**:
  - The project will continue to use Next.js for the frontend.
  - Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI will remain the primary styling and UI component libraries.
  - Supabase will continue to be used for authentication and database management.
