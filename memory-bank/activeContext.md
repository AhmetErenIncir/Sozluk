# Active Context

## Current Focus (2025-09-07)

- **Goal**: Maintain stable word management system with reliable authentication
- **Recent Achievement**: Successfully resolved logout issues after word operations by implementing client-side auth consistency
- **Current Status**: All core functionality working - authentication, word management, admin controls, and session management
- **Next Priorities**:
  - Implement word search and filtering functionality
  - Add word editing and deletion capabilities
  - Enhance admin dashboard with word management statistics

## Recent Critical Fixes (2025-09-07)

### Authentication & Session Management Overhaul

- **Problem**: Users couldn't logout after adding words due to server/client auth conflicts
- **Root Cause**: Mixed server-side and client-side authentication causing session state corruption
- **Solution**:
  - Removed server-side authentication from API routes
  - Implemented pure client-side authentication flow
  - Added `refreshSession()` mechanism in AuthProvider
  - Enhanced logout function with multiple fallback strategies
- **Impact**: Logout now works reliably regardless of previous operations

<<<<<<< HEAD
### API Architecture Simplification

- **Change**: Modified `/api/dictionary/words` POST endpoint to accept user data from client
- **Benefit**: Eliminated auth conflicts and improved reliability
- **Pattern**: Client validates auth, passes user data to API, API handles database operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive HTTP status codes with clear error messages

### Session Refresh Implementation

- **Added**: `refreshSession()` function to AuthProvider context
- **Usage**: Called after successful word operations and during logout
- **Purpose**: Ensures auth state remains synchronized across components
- **Fallback**: Window redirect if normal refresh fails

## Recent Changes (2025-01-16 to 2025-09-07)

### Word Management System

- **Dictionary Table**: Created comprehensive schema with word, meaning, language, part_of_speech, etymology, pronunciation, example_sentences, related_words
- **Add Word Page**: Full-featured form with validation, admin-only access, and success feedback
- **API Integration**: RESTful endpoint with proper error handling and response formatting
- **Related Words**: Dynamic selection component with search functionality

### User Management & Profiles

- **Profiles Table**: Enhanced with email field for better admin tracking
- **Admin System**: Role-based access with automatic triggers for new users
- **Migration**: Successfully migrated existing auth users to profiles system
- **Access Control**: Protected routes with automatic redirects for unauthorized users

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Navigation**: Cleaned up navbar with proper admin controls and logout positioning
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states with user-friendly messages
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with clear error feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper responsive layouts

### Authentication Flow Refinements

- **Login/Signup Protection**: Automatic redirects for already authenticated users
- **Session Persistence**: Improved session handling across page refreshes
- **Error Recovery**: Multiple fallback mechanisms for failed auth operations
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting auth issues

## Technical Decisions & Patterns

### Authentication Strategy

- **Decision**: Client-side authentication with API route data passing
- **Rationale**: Eliminates server/client state conflicts and improves reliability
- **Implementation**: AuthProvider manages all auth state, API routes receive user data from client
- **Benefits**: Consistent session management, better error handling, simplified debugging

### Error Handling Philosophy

- **Pattern**: Multiple layers of error handling with graceful degradation
- **Implementation**: Try/catch blocks with specific error types and fallback strategies
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages with appropriate actions (redirects, retries)
- **Logging**: Comprehensive console logging for development and debugging

### State Management Approach

- **Context Pattern**: AuthProvider for global auth state management
- **Local State**: Component-level state for forms and UI interactions
- **Session Synchronization**: Regular refresh mechanisms to maintain consistency
- **Performance**: Minimal re-renders with optimized context usage

## Open Questions & Future Considerations

### Search Implementation

- **Question**: Full-text search vs. simple filtering for word lookup
- **Consideration**: Performance implications with growing word database
- **Options**: Supabase full-text search, client-side filtering, or hybrid approach

### Scalability Planning

- **Database**: Current schema supports growth, may need indexing optimization
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth scales well, consider rate limiting for API routes
- **UI**: Component structure supports feature expansion

### Admin Features

- **Word Management**: Edit/delete functionality for admin users
- **User Management**: Admin dashboard for user role management
- **Analytics**: Usage statistics and word popularity tracking

## Assumptions & Constraints

### Technical Assumptions

- **Supabase Reliability**: Assuming consistent uptime and performance
- **Next.js Stability**: Using stable features of App Router and SSR
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with JavaScript enabled

### Business Constraints

- **Admin Management**: Manual admin role assignment (no self-registration)
- **Content Moderation**: Trust-based system for admin-added content
- **Language Support**: Initially focused on Turkish with multi-language schema

### Development Constraints

- **Single Developer**: All decisions and implementations by one person
- **No CI/CD**: Manual deployment and testing processes
- **Limited Testing**: Manual testing without automated test suites

## Decisions

- **Decision**: Implement a `memory-bank/` directory for project context management.
  - **Rationale**: Centralizes project knowledge, ensures consistency, and provides a clear reference for all team members and future development.
  - **Impact**: Improves project understanding, reduces onboarding time, and facilitates more efficient development cycles.
  - **Risks**: Requires diligent maintenance to keep information up-to-date.

## Open Questions & Assumptions

- **Open Questions**:
  - What specific database technology will be used for the backend?
  - What backend framework will be chosen (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go)?
  - Detailed API specifications for frontend-backend communication.
- **Assumptions**:
  - The project will continue to use Next.js for the frontend.
  - Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI will remain the primary styling and UI component libraries.
  - Supabase will continue to be used for authentication and database management.
