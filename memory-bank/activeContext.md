# Active Context
## Plan (current)
- **Goal**: Add Login and Sign Up buttons to the top left of the landing page navigation bar (next to the logo), and create dedicated login and signup pages with forms that users navigate to upon clicking the buttons.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Login and Sign Up buttons are visible on the left side of the nav bar.
  - Clicking Login navigates to /login page with a form (email, password, submit).
  - Clicking Sign Up navigates to /signup page with a form (email, password, confirm password, submit).
  - Forms use Shadcn UI components for consistency.
  - Navigation works without errors, and UI is responsive.
- **Risks**: 
  - Potential styling conflicts in the nav bar layout.
  - Need to add additional Shadcn components if not already installed (e.g., form, label).
- **Deliverables**: Updated page.tsx with buttons, new login.tsx and signup.tsx pages.

## Recent Changes
- Initial setup of the dictionary project, including `frontend` and `backend` directories.
- Next.js application initialized in `frontend` with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Shadcn UI configured and essential components (button, card, input) added.
- A modern landing page (`frontend/app/page.tsx`) has been designed and implemented.
- `lucide-react` installed for icons on the landing page.
- `trae.md` documentation file created and updated.

## Decisions
- **Decision**: Implement a `memory-bank/` directory for project context management.
  - **Rationale**: Centralizes project knowledge, ensures consistency, and provides a clear reference for all team members and future development.
  - **Impact**: Improves project understanding, reduces onboarding time, and facilitates more efficient development cycles.
  - **Risks**: Requires diligent maintenance to keep information up-to-date.

## Open Questions & Assumptions
- **Open Questions**: 
  - What specific database technology will be used for the backend?
  - What backend framework will be chosen (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go)?
  - Detailed API specifications for frontend-backend communication.
- **Assumptions**: 
  - The project will continue to use Next.js for the frontend.
  - Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI will remain the primary styling and UI component libraries.
