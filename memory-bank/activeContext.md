# Active Context
## Plan (current)
- **Goal**: To establish a robust project context management system using the `memory-bank/` directory as the single source of truth for all project-related information.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The `memory-bank/` directory is created at the project root.
  - All required core `memory-bank` files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are created with initial content based on the provided templates and current project status.
  - The content of these files accurately reflects the current state and plan of the Sözlük project.
- **Risks**: 
  - Incomplete or inaccurate initial documentation.
  - Overlooking critical project details during initial context creation.
- **Deliverables**: Populated `memory-bank/` directory with initial project context files.

## Recent Changes
- Initial setup of the dictionary project, including `frontend` and `backend` directories.
- Next.js application initialized in `frontend` with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Shadcn UI configured and essential components (button, card, input) added.
- A modern landing page (`frontend/app/page.tsx`) has been designed and implemented.
- `lucide-react` installed for icons on the landing page.
- `trae.md` documentation file created and updated.

## Decisions
- **Decision**: Implement a `memory-bank/` directory for project context management.
  - **Rationale**: Centralizes project knowledge, ensures consistency, and provides a clear reference for all team members and future development.
  - **Impact**: Improves project understanding, reduces onboarding time, and facilitates more efficient development cycles.
  - **Risks**: Requires diligent maintenance to keep information up-to-date.

## Open Questions & Assumptions
- **Open Questions**: 
  - What specific database technology will be used for the backend?
  - What backend framework will be chosen (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go)?
  - Detailed API specifications for frontend-backend communication.
- **Assumptions**: 
  - The project will continue to use Next.js for the frontend.
  - Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI will remain the primary styling and UI component libraries.
