# Active Context
## Plan (completed)
- **Goal**: Implement admin role identification using Supabase without a separate login page by adding an 'is_admin' flag and checking it post-login.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can log in normally.
  - After login, fetch profile to check 'is_admin' and store in context.
  - Enable admin features based on role.
  - Update memory-bank files accordingly.
- **Risks**:  
  - Security: Ensure admin checks are secure.
  - Performance: Additional query after login.
- **Deliverables**: Updated AuthProvider with role, login page with profile fetch, admin logic in UI.

## Recent Changes
- Initial setup of the dictionary project, including `frontend` and `backend` directories.
- Next.js application initialized in `frontend` with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Shadcn UI configured and essential components (button, card, input) added.
- A modern landing page (`frontend/app/page.tsx`) has been designed and implemented.
- `lucide-react` installed for icons on the landing page.
- `trae.md` documentation file created and updated.
- Supabase integration: Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` and `@supabase/ssr`, configured environment variables, created Supabase clients, integrated auth into login and signup pages, added AuthProvider for session management.
- Added profiles table in Supabase with is_admin column and trigger for new users.
- Updated AuthProvider to fetch and provide isAdmin in context.

## Decisions
- **Decision**: Implement a `memory-bank/` directory for project context management.
  - **Rationale**: Centralizes project knowledge, ensures consistency, and provides a clear reference for all team members and future development.
  - **Impact**: Improves project understanding, reduces onboarding time, and facilitates more efficient development cycles.
  - **Risks**: Requires diligent maintenance to keep information up-to-date.

## Open Questions & Assumptions
- **Open Questions**: 
  - What specific database technology will be used for the backend?
  - What backend framework will be chosen (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go)?
  - Detailed API specifications for frontend-backend communication.
- **Assumptions**: 
  - The project will continue to use Next.js for the frontend.
  - Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI will remain the primary styling and UI component libraries.
