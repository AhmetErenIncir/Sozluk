# Progress
## Status Summary
- **Working**:
  - Frontend Next.js application with App Router
  - Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI integration
  - Landing page with hero section, features, and CTA
  - User authentication with Supabase
  - Admin functionality and role management
  - **Visual Thesaurus Graph (New!)**:
    - Interactive force-directed graph visualization
    - Click-to-navigate word exploration
    - Smart text positioning with collision detection
    - Turkish language support with proper normalization
    - Performance-optimized WebGL rendering
    - History navigation with breadcrumbs
    - Zustand state management with persistence
- **Partial**:
  - Backend API setup (using Next.js API routes currently)
  - Full dictionary CRUD operations
  - User profile customization
- **Completed Recently**:
  - Visual Thesaurus implementation
  - Graph API endpoint
  - Turkish text normalization utilities
  - Mock and Supabase data sources

## To-Do
- [P1] ~~Implement Visual Thesaurus graph~~ ✅ COMPLETED
- [P2] Enhance dictionary search with filters and advanced options
- [P3] Add user favorites and word history
- [P4] Implement word contribution system
- [P5] Add pronunciation audio support
- [P6] Create mobile-responsive graph controls
- [P7] Add graph export functionality (PNG/SVG)
- [P8] Implement collaborative word exploration

## Known Issues
- Graph performance may degrade with >100 nodes (current limit: 50)
- Some Turkish characters may not display correctly in older browsers
- Graph physics simulation can be CPU-intensive on low-end devices

## Milestones
- **M1: Initial Project Setup (Completed)**: Frontend and backend directories created, Next.js app initialized, Shadcn UI integrated, basic landing page implemented.
- **M2: Visual Thesaurus (Completed)**: Interactive graph visualization with full Turkish language support, smart positioning, and navigation.
- **M3: Core Dictionary (In Progress)**: Complete word search, definition display, and CRUD operations.
- **M4: User Features (Planned)**: User profiles, favorites, history, and personalization.
- **M5: Advanced Features (Future)**: Audio pronunciation, etymology, example sentences, word games.

## Recent Achievements
